# Orca Lean - Data Visualization Backend

This backend provides the data and APIs necessary for the Orca Lean data visualization application. It utilizes Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to handle data storage, processing, and API interactions.

Key Features
Data Storage: Securely stores and manages data relevant to the visualization needs of the Orca Lean application.
API Endpoints: Provides well-defined APIs for fetching data in various formats (e.g., JSON, CSV) to support different visualization requirements.
Data Transformation: Processes and transforms raw data to meet the specific needs of the visualization tools.
Authentication : Implements user authentication and authorization to control data access and maintain security.
Rate Limiting : Protects against excessive API usage and potential abuse.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/VishalJuyal/orca-lean-backend.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd orca-lean-backend
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Usage
Start the development server:

Bash

npm start
This will start the server on the port specified in the PORT environment variable (defaults to 3000).

Access the API endpoints using a tool like Postman.


Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

├── controllers
│   └── ... (controller files)
├── middlewares
│   └── ... (middleware files)
├── models
│   └── ... (model files)
├── routes
│   └── ... (route files)
├── services
│   └── ... (service files)
├── index.ts
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── ... (other configuration files)


controllers: This directory contains controller files that handle incoming API requests and interact with services.
middlewares: This directory contains middleware functions that are executed before requests reach controllers. They can be used for tasks like authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.
models: This directory contains Mongoose models that represent the data structures stored in the MongoDB database.
routes: This directory contains route definitions that map API endpoints to controller functions.
services: This directory contains service functions that encapsulate business logic, such as data processing and transformation.

Technologies Used
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
Other Tools: CORS (Optional), JSON Web Tokens (JWT) (Optional), Rate Limiter (Optional)
